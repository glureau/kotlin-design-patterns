# Abstract Factory Pattern

## Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

#### Improvement from Java to Kotlin:
None (just a bit more readable)

#### How to improve:
By using a proper DI solution, you will avoid to specify the concrete factory type in the main. This instanciation will be done by the DI itself.
See for example: http://google.github.io/dagger/
